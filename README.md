# Simple NPM Message Board
This was a simple follow along tutorial provided by LinkedIn Learning that
 was designed to refresh my knowledge and skillset with NPM. This web
 application will take the input from the user and will post the message
 to the webpage. The project largely utilizes NPM, Javascript, HTML, and
 Bootstrap.
